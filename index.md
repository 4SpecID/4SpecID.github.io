# What is 4SpecID?

<p align="justify"><b>4SpecID</b> is a C++ based cross-platform program to audit and annotate reference DNA libraries. 
It is oriented to ensure the golden standards for forensic applications.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>4SpecID</b> core translates records in a reference DNA library into weighted undirected graphs where nodes represent species and clustering groups and edges represent records in the database. The isolated subgraphs are then used to evaluate congruence between taxonomic data and genetic clustering and guide the user to identify and fix or remove erroneous data records.
